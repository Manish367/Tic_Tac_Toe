📌 Game Rules
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

Player 1 is "X", Player 2 is "O".

Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.

If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 in a row, the game ends in a draw.
